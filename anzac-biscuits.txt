 150g (1 cup) plain flour
 90g (1 cup) rolled oats (see Notes)
 85g (1 cup) desiccated coconut
 100g (1/2 cup, firmly packed) brown sugar
 55g (1/4 cup) caster sugar
 125g butter
 2 tablespoons golden syrup
 2 tablespoons water
 1/2 teaspoon bicarbonate of soda

Step 1
Preheat oven to 160Â°C. Line 2 baking trays with non-stick baking paper.

Step 2
Combine flour, oats, coconut and combined sugar in a large bowl.

Step 3
Stir the butter, golden syrup and water in a small saucepan over medium heat until the butter melts and the mixture is smooth. Stir in the bicarbonate of soda. Add to the oat mixture and stir until well combined.

Step 4
Roll level tablespoonfuls of the oat mixture into balls and place, about 5cm apart, on the prepared trays. Flatten until about 1cm thick. Bake, swapping trays halfway through cooking, for 15 minutes or until light golden. Set aside for 10 minutes to cool slightly before transferring to wire racks to cool completely.


Notes

Shopping tip: Make sure you buy whole rolled oats - if you use instant oats, the mixture will spread too much and your biscuits will be flat.

Make them your way:

Soft and chewy: Omit the brown sugar and increase the caster sugar to 155g (3/4 cup).

Dark and crunchy: Omit caster sugar. Increase the brown sugar to 155g (3/4 cup, firmly packed). Bake for 18 minutes.

Thin and crispy: Omit the caster sugar. Increase the brown sugar to 200g (1 cup). Reduce the flour to 115g (3/4 cup).
